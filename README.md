# Basel

Basel is an R package for calculating capital requirements according to the Basel Accords. The Basel Committee recognise three major components of risk for a banks that, for which it requires banks to hold regulatory capital for:

  * Credit risk
  * Market risk 
  * Operational risk

For easy reference to the many papers, discussions and FAQs by the Basel Committee see the [Banking of International Settlements (BIS) publications](https://www.bis.org/list/bcbs/).

## Credit Risk

Three approaches are:

  1. Standardised Approach
  2. Foundation IRB
  3. Advanced IRB

See the [explanatory note](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/irbriskweight.pdf) on the IRB risk weights.

## Market Risk 

[BIS paper on minimum capital requirements for Market Risk](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d457.pdf)

### Counter Party Credit Risk

You can find out more about SA-CCR [here](https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs279.htm).

## Operational Risk

Three approaches currently:

  * Basic indicator approach
  * Standardised approach
  * Advanced measurement approach

# Data

Include the results of the EBA Risk Weighted Capital exercise. This contains all the RWAs for each risk type for every participating bank in the EU. Would be a good dataset to include in the package.
