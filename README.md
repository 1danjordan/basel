# Basel

Basel is an R package for calculating capital requirements according to Basel III. It's primary purpose is as a learning device. I'm developing it to better understand how capital requirements are calculated, why they are calculated this way and what it is sensitive to.

This package follows the standardised approach for measuring counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR) exposures which took affect in January 2017. You can find out more about SA-CCR [here](https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs279.htm).

## Asymptotic Single Factor Model

The ASFM is the theoretical model that underpins SA-CRR. Plan is to understand this model, it's strengths and weaknesses.
